knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Step 1: Exploring `storms` data

The `storms` data are built-in to the `dplyr` package..

Get a summary for each variable: 
```{r}
summary(storms)
```

Look at the variable names: 
```{r}
names(storms)
```

## Step 2: Exploratory visualization

```{r}
ggplot(data = storms, aes(x = category, y = pressure)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, 
              alpha = 0.5,
              color = "blue",
              show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Storm CategorrY", 
       y = "Air pressure at storm center (millibars)", title 
       = "This is hard"
       ) +
  theme_bw()
```
